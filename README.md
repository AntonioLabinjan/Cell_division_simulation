# Cell_division_simulation
Python simulation of cell division

This repository contains a Python script that simulates cell division over time. Cell division is a fundamental biological process where a single cell divides to create two or more daughter cells.

## Overview
In this simulation, we start with an initial number of cells (stations) and observe their division and growth over a specified period of time. The simulation generates random events to mimic the division and death of cells, resulting in changes in the total number of cells.

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute the cell_division_simulation.py script. You can adjust the following parameters within the script to customize the simulation:

broj_stanica: Initial number of cells.
vrijeme_simulacije: Total simulation time in seconds.
nova_stanica: Randomly generated number of new cells in each time step.

## Visualization
The simulation provides insights into how the number of cells changes over time. The results are visualized in a plot that shows the number of cells on the y-axis and time (in seconds) on the x-axis.

## Example
Here's an example of running the simulation:

bash
Copy code
python Dioba_stanica.py

## Note
This simulation is a simplified model for educational purposes and does not capture the complexity of real cell division processes. It is intended to demonstrate the concept of cell division and how the number of cells can change over time.
